🗓️ Daily Habit Tracker (React App)
A minimalist habit-tracking app built with React to help you build and maintain daily habits.

📌 Why I Built This

✨ Features
✅ Add custom habits to track

📆 Check off habits daily

🔄 Reset all habits when needed

💾 Data persistence using localStorage (your habits stay even after refreshing)
